I really am trying to get into my local beers.  I enjoyed the Hope Knot IPA, so my wife surprised me for a lunch date at Four Peaks!  \\\\n\\\\nThe place was a little less polished than I imaged it would be, sort of a sports bar feel.  The food seletion looked good, typcial bar fare combined with some very unique selections.  We only order some pretzels...and I ordered the taster set so that I could explore their full line of beers.  The beer was good overall, not the best I have had.  I still think the Hop Knot is one of their best, and their ales are strong as well.  \\\\n\\\\nThe best thing about this place was the incredible service.  Despite the super casual feel, the service was fantastic.  Our server covered every detail, offered wonderful suggestions and check on us often.  When I asked about the building and beer production, she fetched the manager (Mike), who was very gracious to take the time to tell us more about the brewery (the building dates back to the 19th century!).  \\\\n\\\\nVery much enjoyed our lunch, I would come back with some of my buddies for a beer anytime.'"
